# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the ROSArduinoBridge Arduino firmware to provide flexible motor control capabilities that support multiple motor driver configurations, optional encoder usage, and both differential drive and mecanum wheel drive modes. The enhancement will allow users to configure their robot for different hardware setups without requiring separate firmware versions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Optional Encoder Support

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to operate my robot without encoders when they are not available or needed, so that I can use the firmware with simpler hardware configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NO_ENCODERS is defined THEN the system SHALL disable all encoder-related functionality
2. WHEN NO_ENCODERS is defined THEN PID control SHALL be disabled automatically
3. WHEN NO_ENCODERS is defined THEN motor commands SHALL operate in direct PWM mode
4. WHEN encoder functions are called with NO_ENCODERS defined THEN the system SHALL return zero values without error
5. IF encoders are available THEN the system SHALL maintain full PID control functionality

### Requirement 2: TB6612 Motor Driver Support

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to use the TB6612 motor driver with my Arduino, so that I can control 2 or 4 motors efficiently with a reliable driver.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SPARKFUN_TB6612 is defined THEN the system SHALL initialize TB6612 motor driver
2. WHEN in 2-motor mode THEN the system SHALL control left and right motor groups
3. WHEN in 4-motor mode THEN the system SHALL control individual front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right motors
4. WHEN motor speed is set THEN the TB6612 driver SHALL receive appropriate PWM and direction signals
5. IF motor speed exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL clamp values to valid range (-255 to 255)

### Requirement 3: Differential Drive Mode

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to operate my robot in differential drive mode, so that I can control a traditional two-wheeled robot with left and right motor control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN USE_MECANUM is not defined THEN the system SHALL operate in differential drive mode
2. WHEN receiving MOTOR_SPEEDS command THEN the system SHALL set left and right motor speeds
3. WHEN receiving MOTOR_RAW_PWM command THEN the system SHALL accept two PWM values for left and right motors
4. IF encoders are available THEN the system SHALL use diff_controller for PID control
5. WHEN in differential mode THEN steering commands SHALL be ignored

### Requirement 4: Mecanum Wheel Drive Mode

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to operate my robot with mecanum wheels, so that I can achieve omnidirectional movement with four independently controlled motors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN USE_MECANUM is defined THEN the system SHALL operate in mecanum drive mode
2. WHEN receiving MOTOR_RAW_PWM command THEN the system SHALL accept four PWM values for FL, FR, RL, RR motors
3. WHEN receiving MECANUM_TWIST command THEN the system SHALL convert velocity commands to individual motor speeds
4. WHEN in mecanum mode THEN the system SHALL use mecanum_controller for motion control
5. IF encoders are available THEN each motor SHALL have independent encoder feedback

### Requirement 5: Mecanum Controller Implementation

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want a dedicated mecanum controller, so that I can properly handle omnidirectional motion control with appropriate kinematics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mecanum_controller is active THEN the system SHALL implement mecanum wheel kinematics
2. WHEN receiving twist commands (vx, vy, wz) THEN the controller SHALL calculate individual wheel speeds
3. WHEN encoders are available THEN each wheel SHALL have independent PID control
4. WHEN encoders are not available THEN the controller SHALL operate in open-loop mode
5. IF wheel speeds exceed limits THEN the controller SHALL scale all speeds proportionally

### Requirement 6: Configuration Flexibility

**User Story:** As a robotics developer, I want to easily configure my robot's drive system through compile-time definitions, so that I can adapt the firmware to different hardware configurations without code modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compile-time flags are set THEN the system SHALL automatically configure appropriate motor and encoder drivers
2. WHEN conflicting configurations are detected THEN the system SHALL generate compile-time errors
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN only relevant code SHALL be compiled
4. IF invalid motor driver is selected THEN the system SHALL display helpful error message
5. WHEN configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL initialize all components correctly

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user of ROSArduinoBridge, I want my current robot configuration to continue working, so that I don't need to modify my existing setup when upgrading firmware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing motor driver definitions THEN the system SHALL maintain current functionality
2. WHEN using existing command protocol THEN all commands SHALL work as before
3. WHEN encoders are configured as before THEN PID control SHALL operate identically
4. IF new features are not enabled THEN the system SHALL behave exactly as the original version
5. WHEN upgrading firmware THEN existing ROS2 integration SHALL continue to function
